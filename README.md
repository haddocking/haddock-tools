 haddock-tools
================================================

Set of useful HADDOCK utility scripts, which requires Python 3.7+.

About
---------
This is a collection of scripts useful for pre- and post-processing and analysis for HADDOCK runs.
Requests for new scripts will be taken into consideration, depending on the effort and general usability of the script.


Installation
------------
Download the zip archive or clone the repository with git. This last is the recommended option as it
is then extremely simple to get updates.

```bash
# To download
git clone https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-tools

# To compile the executables
cd haddock-tools
make

# To update
cd haddock-tools && git pull origin master
```

Scripts
------------


## Restraints-related

#### passive_from_active.py
A python script to obtain a list of passive residues providing a PDB file and a list of active residues.
This will automatically calculate a list of surface residues from the PDB to filter out buried residues except if
a surface list is provided.
By default, neighbors of the active residues are searched within 6.5 Angstroms and surface residues are residues whose
relative side chain accessibility or main chain accessibility is above 15%.

Requirements:
* [FreeSASA](https://freesasa.github.io/)

`pip install freesasa`
* [BioPython](http://biopython.org/)

`pip install biopython`

Usage:
```bash
./passive_from_active.py [-h] [-c CHAIN_ID] [-s SURFACE_LIST]
                              pdb_file active_list

positional arguments:
  pdb_file              PDB file
  active_list           List of active residues IDs (int) separated by commas

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CHAIN_ID, --chain-id CHAIN_ID
                        Chain id to be used in the PDB file (default: All)
  -s SURFACE_LIST, --surface-list SURFACE_LIST
                        List of surface residues IDs (int) separated by commas
```

#### active-passive_to_ambig.py
A python script to create ambiguous interaction restraints for use in HADDOCK based on list of active and passive residues (refer to the [HADDOCK software page](http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2/haddock.html) for more information)

Usage:
```bash
     ./active-passive_to_ambig.py <active-passive-file1> <active-passive-file2>
```

where <active-passive-file> is a file consisting of two space-delimited lines with
the first line active residues numbers and the second line passive residue numbers. One file per input structure should thus be provided.


#### restrain_bodies.py
A python script to creates distance restraints to lock several chains together.
Useful to avoid unnatural flexibility or movement due to
sequence/numbering gaps during the refinement stage of HADDOCK.

Usage:
```bash
./restrain_bodies.py [-h] [--exclude EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]] [--verbose] structures [structures ...]

  positional arguments:
    structures            PDB structures to restraint

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --exclude EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...], -e EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...] Chains to exclude from the calculation
    --verbose, -v
```

#### restrain_ligand.py
Calculates distances between neighboring residues of a ligand molecule and produces a set of
unambiguous distance restraints for HADDOCK to keep it in place during semi-flexible refinement.
Produces, at most, one restraint per ligand atom.

Usage:
```bash
./restrain_ligand.py [-h] -l LIGAND [-p] pdbf

positional arguments:
  pdbf                  PDB file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LIGAND, --ligand LIGAND
                        Ligand residue name
  -p, --pml             Write Pymol file with restraints
```

#### haddock_tbl_validation
The validate_tbl.py script in that directoy will check the correctness of your restraints (CNS format) for HADDOCK.

Usage:
```bash
usage: python validate_tbl.py [-h] [--pcs] file

This script validates a restraint file (*.tbl).

positional arguments:
  file        TBL file to be validated

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit
    --pcs       PCS mode
```

```

#### `renumber_model.py`

A python script to match chains of a model to a given reference. The numbering relationship is obtained via sequence alignment with BLOSUM62 matrix. This is only indicated for complexes with high similarity.

This script supports multi-chain complexes but expects the chains to match sequentially between the `reference` and the `model`.

```text
Ref  Model
A   A
B   B
C   C
```

Usage:

```text
